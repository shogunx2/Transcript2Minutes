Meeting: Engineering Sprint Retrospective and Planning
Participants: Marcus (Tech Lead), Priya (Backend Engineer), Alex (Frontend Engineer), Sarah (QA Lead), David (Product Manager)
Date: November 5, 2025
Duration: 60 minutes

Marcus: Welcome everyone to our sprint retrospective. We've completed Sprint 23. Let's start with what went well. Priya, can you share the backend improvements?

Priya: Sure. We successfully implemented the new caching layer which improved API response times by 45%. We also completed the database optimization work. These changes will significantly reduce server costs. However, we encountered some unexpected issues with the migration script. It took us an extra 3 days to resolve, but we've documented everything for future reference.

Alex: On the frontend side, we delivered the new dashboard redesign on schedule. Users are really happy with the simplified navigation. We also reduced the bundle size by 30% through code splitting and lazy loading. The performance metrics show a 25% improvement in page load times. One challenge was coordinating with the API changes - we had to refactor some components, but it's working smoothly now.

Sarah: QA had a productive sprint. We increased test coverage from 72% to 81%. We identified 23 bugs during testing, and our team worked closely with engineering to resolve them before release. Most were minor, but we caught 2 critical issues that could have impacted production. We also automated some regression tests, which will save us time in future sprints.

David: Excellent work everyone. From a product perspective, the new features are performing well. User feedback is positive. Now let's discuss our next sprint priorities. We have three major features on the roadmap: the new reporting system, API rate limiting improvements, and mobile app optimization.

Marcus: I recommend we prioritize the API rate limiting first. It's critical for stability. For the reporting system, we should break it into smaller chunks. Priya, can you estimate the backend work for rate limiting?

Priya: Yes, I'd say 3-4 days for implementation and testing. We should also add comprehensive logging so we can monitor how clients are using the API.

Alex: For the reporting system UI, I'd need the backend API specs first. Can we have those by end of week?

Priya: Absolutely. I'll draft the specs tomorrow and get them reviewed.

Sarah: I'll start writing test cases based on the feature descriptions. That way we're ready to test as soon as development starts.

David: Perfect coordination. Marcus, what about the mobile optimization work?

Marcus: That's a bigger undertaking. I estimate 2 sprints for significant improvements. We could start that in Sprint 25 if we finish the rate limiting work in Sprint 24.

David: Sounds good. Let me also mention we have a client demo next week for the new dashboard. Can we prepare a short demo video?

Alex: Sure, I can create that by Thursday. It'll showcase the key improvements.

Marcus: Great. Let's also do a quick debrief on the caching layer challenges. Let's schedule a 30-minute session with Priya and the team to document lessons learned.

Sarah: I'll capture all the bugs and issues in our tracking system today so we can analyze trends.

David: Excellent. This sprint was productive. Let's maintain this momentum. Team did great work. Next sprint planning is next Tuesday. Everyone should be ready with their estimates.

All: Thanks, great meeting.
